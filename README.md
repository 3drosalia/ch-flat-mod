# ch-flat-mod

idk, i'm just making a flat version of clone hero, it's just textures, the data.unity3d file should be included eventually when i finally get around to updating it

go to Issues to submit any problems you may see, whether it be from a video i published or your gameplay (illegal!), have a good day.

inspired by doodle hero and a random thought i had in english class
